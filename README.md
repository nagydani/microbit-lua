# Microbit Lua

Lua compiled for the [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) SBC.


# How

The
[microbit-v2-samples](https://github.com/lancaster-university/microbit-v2-samples)
repo has been forked, stripped, and modified to download Lua v5.1.5
and compile it as the main payload of the firmware. It builds upon
[CODAL](https://tech.microbit.org/software/runtime/) and exposes its
API to the Lua runtime.

When the board is powered on then the Lua VM is initialized and the
firmware payload (the `source/lua-script.lua` file) is evaluated. This
payload can be replaced by the `hextract` script without recompiling
the firmware image.

The hextract tool requires a known layout of the firmware. For that we
need to edit the linker script, but that lives in the
`codal-microbit-v2` repo. To avoid having to patch CODAL itself, we
introduce a phase in our build script that applies the
`source/nrf52833-softdevice.ld.diff` patch to CODAL's linker script.

## Building

The simplest and most reliable way to build it is by using the
included `Dockerfile`:

1) Build the container image: `podman build --platform linux/amd64 -t
   microbit -f Dockerfile .`

2) Build the firmware (from the project root): `podman run --tty --rm
   --volume "$(pwd)":/workspace --workdir /workspace microbit -c
   ./build.py`

3) Alternatively, you can start a shell and work inside the container:
   `podman run --tty --rm --interactive --volume "$(pwd)":/workspace
   --workdir /workspace microbit`

The current directory will be shared with the container under
`/workspace`.


## Flashing

The Microbit board exposes a pendrive-like interface. Mount it like
any other pendrive and just copy the `MICROBIT.hex` file to it. While
flashing, the orange led next to the USB connector will be blinking
fast. A few seconds later the firmware is automatically started.

To avoid manually mounting the drive, you can use this on an typical
Linux:

```shell
udisksctl mount -b $(lsblk -o NAME,LABEL | awk '$2=="MICROBIT"{print "/dev/"$1}') && \
  cp MICROBIT.hex /run/media/${USER}/MICROBIT/
```


## Updating the Lua payload

The `utils/hextract` command line tool can be used to extract and
embed the Lua payload in a .hex file. It's a Lua script written by
LLMs, compatible with Lua 5.1.

Some technical details are documented in
[utils/hextract.md](utils/hextract.md).
